My GitHub Pages page for showcasing my contributions and personal projects.

## About
Nothing says you can web-dev, quite like using a theme that somebody else spent a lot of time designing, and laying it on top of a full-blown web-publishing platform that automates builds from markdown files. :D

Platform for highlighting contributions that I’ve made to others’ projects, and to host technical documentation for my own.

Uses v 4.16.4 of [Michael Rose's "minimal-mistakes" theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes)
